        <p class="fs-5">
          PokeTrade lets you buy and trade Pokémon through the Marketplace.
          You can browse, sort by price, or search for specific Pokémon to find what you want.
          Buying is instant — simply select a Pokémon and complete the purchase.
          Trading happens automatically when two Pokémon of equal value are listed and the user initiates a trade, making exchanges quick and fair.
          Your profile updates automatically to reflect all your new Pokémon after each purchase or trade.
        </p>
